# Year Project

- **The theme** of the project is an extension for VScode, which would allow convenient search and work with the same (linked) entities in different subroutines.

- **The problem** is that if we have a large project, then to find a particular entity, we have to go through each file and look for that entity and its context, which is annoying and slow if we have a large project.
  The solution should make this possible quickly and simply

- **The goal** of the project is to invent and implement a program that would parse the project and allow the use of created entities in a large project
